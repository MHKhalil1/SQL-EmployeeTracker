## Description
This assignment was assigned by the Case-Western Coding Bootcamp. The goal is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. I had to create a Employee Tracker, which is going to be a easy way to track everything important regarding an employee through the backend.
